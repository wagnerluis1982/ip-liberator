0.2.4 (2019-10-10)
------------------

Added
+++++

- Improve script output showing version and a cool summary of settings.

Fixed
+++++

- When using a tag, the script was always reauthorizing even when IP was not changed,
  this version fixed this bad behavior.

0.2.3 (2019-09-20)
------------------

Fixed
+++++

- Fix tagged rule is retagged when authorizing or revoking

0.2.2 (2019-09-18)
------------------

This release marks a breaking change. Now the script "tags" recorded entries in
the security groups, e.g. ``[ip-liberator] SSH John`` instead of only ``SSH John``.
That helps to identify what IP Liberator added and what was added by hand.

By default, the tag is **ip-liberator**, but can be change through the new
option ``--tag``. If the user wants the previous behavior, i.e. without a tag,
he or she must pass the option ``--no-tag``.

Added
+++++

- Add option ``--operator`` to change the profile operator.
- Add short option ``-p`` for ``--profile``
- Add option ``--version`` to show current script version.
